## Exercise 7

In this exercise you will: intentionally remove data from the slave, re-checksum the cluster and fix the drift.

* 7.1 - Remove Data from the Slave

  Under normal production environments, your slaves are ran in read-only mode (if they aren't, fix this!).
  There are two ways you can override the read-only flag: replication and any user with SUPER privilege.
  
  Let's log in to our MySQL-DB2 instance and remove some data. We can do this because we have the SUPER 
  privelege on our 'root' account.

  `mysql-db2> DELETE FROM company_name WHERE RAND()*100 < 5;`

  This will remove several thousand rows from the table.

* 7.2 - Detect Slave Drift

  Now, let's log back in to our MySQL-DB1 (master) instance and re-run our checksum. If we suspect a single table 
  might have some problems in it, we can checksum just that one table to save some time.
  
  ```
  pt-table-checksum  h=localhost -d imdb -t company_name -u checksum -pchecksum1 \
    --no-check-binlog-format --no-version-check
  ```
  
  You'll notice the command is almost the same as the previous exercise but with the addition 
  of **-d** and **-t** which allow you to specify a single database and table or multiple databases 
  and tables in a comma-separated list.
  
  You should have seen this as your output:
  
  ```
              TS ERRORS  DIFFS     ROWS  CHUNKS SKIPPED    TIME TABLE
  10-11T15:26:02      0      1   241457       5       0   3.661 imdb.company_name
  ```
  
  As you can see, under the __DIFFS__ column, it shows 1, indicating 1 of the 5 chunks had a problem on a slave.

* 7.3 - Fixing Slave Drift
  
  Now that we have successfully detected the drift, we need to fix it. We do that with 
  another Percona Toolkit tool named __pt-table-sync__.
  
  pt-table-checksum saves all of the chunk/checksum information to a table called 
  __checksums__ in the __percona__ database. pt-table-sync is able to read this data 
  and isolate which chunk is bad and then do a row-by-row comparison to find that 
  specific row (or rows) that may be missing or have incorrect column-level values.
  
  Let's use pt-table-sync to first display the SQL necessary to fix the slave. 
  First, log back in to your MySQL-DB1 (master) instance.
  
  ```
  pt-table-sync --replicate percona.checksums h=localhost,u=checksum,p=checksum1 \
    -d imdb -t company_name --no-version-check --print | wc -l
  ```
  
  The output redirect (ie: pipe) to *w*ord *c*ount is optional. It serves as a quick check that the tool will execute the same number of SQL statements, as the number of rows we deleted originally, to fix the slave. You use _--print_ to sanity check what will be executed on the master. 
  
  Remember that last part: __executed on the master__
  
  We __NEVER__ execute directly on the slave. We always execute on the master and let 
  the changes flow through replication. Because the master already has this data, the 
  command is considered a no-op (no operation) and doesn't incur any significant load 
  on the master. The DML still flows thru replication down to all slaves.
  
  Run the tool again, this time specifying __--execute__ to actually execute each statement.
  
  ```
  pt-table-sync --replicate percona.checksums h=localhost,u=checksum,p=checksum1 \
    -d imdb -t company_name --execute --verbose
  ```
  
  You should see output similar to this:
  
  ```
  # DELETE REPLACE INSERT UPDATE ALGORITHM START    END      EXIT DATABASE.TABLE
  #      0    1001      0      0 Chunk     18:16:45 18:16:46 2    imdb.company_name
  ```
  
  We can see here that 1001 REPLACE statements were executed. Let's verify the checksum again.
  
* 7.4 - Verify Fixed Drift
  
  Let's run another checksum on just this table and verify our __pt-table-sync__ worked.
  
  ```
  pt-table-checksum  h=localhost -d imdb -t company_name -u checksum -pchecksum1 \
    --no-check-binlog-format --no-version-check
    
              TS ERRORS  DIFFS     ROWS  CHUNKS SKIPPED    TIME TABLE
  10-11T18:18:48      0      0   241457       5       0   2.670 imdb.company_name
  ```
  
  Excellent! Our checksum now show no differences between our master and our slave.
